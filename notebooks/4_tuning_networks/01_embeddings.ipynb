    "Because we can want to work with a vectorspace in the hidden layers of our model, the question is, how do we convert words into vectors? The answer is tokenization. \n",
    "With tokenization we map strings to arbitrary integers, and use the integers to look up a vector in a table (the embedding).\n",

    "### What is BPE?\n",
    "\n",
    "BPE (Byte Pair Encoding) is a subword tokenization algorithm. Instead of splitting words into individual characters or using entire words as tokens, BPE breaks words into smaller subword units. It starts with individual characters and merges the most frequent pairs of characters iteratively, creating subwords that can effectively represent both common words and rare or new words through combinations of these subwords.\n",
    "A rough outline of the BPE algorithm is as follows:\n",
    "1.\tStart with characters: Initially, BPE represents each word as a sequence of characters.\n",
    "2.\tIterative merging: It then identifies the most frequent pairs of characters and merges them into a single token. This process continues, merging pairs iteratively until the specified vocabulary size is reached.\n",
    "3.\tHandling rare words: With BPE, rare words that haven’t been seen during training can still be decomposed into recognizable subword tokens (e.g., “unhappiness” might become [“un”, “happy”, “ness”]).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is BPE better than a naive tokenizer?\n",
    "\n",
    "A naive tokenizer splits on spaces, treating each word as a token. This approach doesn’t work well for rare words, misspellings, or words not seen during training, as they would each be treated as unique tokens. BPE helps by breaking these words into smaller subword units, ensuring that even rare or new words can still be tokenized into meaningful subparts, reducing the size of the vocabulary and improving generalization."
