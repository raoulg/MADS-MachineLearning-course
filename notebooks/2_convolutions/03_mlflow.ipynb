    "- End-to-end ML lifecycle management: While TensorBoard focuses on visualizing model training metrics and gin-config on hyperparameter configuration, MLflow covers a broader range of tasks, such as experiment tracking, model packaging, and deployment.\n",

    "- Framework agnostic: MLflow is not tied to a specific ML framework, making it suitable for projects using different libraries or even multiple libraries.\n",

    "- Model Registry: MLflow provides a centralized model registry, allowing you to version, track, and manage your models, which is not available in TensorBoard or gin-config.\n",

    "- Deployment support: MLflow facilitates model deployment to various platforms, such as local, cloud, or Kubernetes environments, whereas TensorBoard and gin-config are not built for deployment tasks.\n",
